                <p>The above snippet are the imagined sounds of a typical tennis rally, or maybe a particularly lively farmhouse.
                </p>
                <p>For the uninitiated, tennis is a racket sport enjoyed by many around in the world, be it in a recreational or competitive sense.
                You can grab a buddy, some chilled drinks and have a swell time hitting rallies or if you’re a popular fellow, you and three others could have a go at it with a pair on either side of the net.
                </p>
                <p>If you harbour embers of a competitive spirit, then you might want to look at how a tennis match is scored. A tennis match is structured similarly to a Matroyshka/Russian doll: a match constitutes of sets which constitutes of games.
                </p>
                <p>Matches are played either to the best of 3 or the best of 5, though the latter is reserved for the men’s singles category of Grand Slams.
                </p>
                <p>A set is won by the person who gets to 6 games first AND has beaten the other player by 2 games, so the score for a set could look like this 6-(4,3,2,1,0) or 7-5. If both players reach 6 games won, a tiebreak is conducted. A tiebreak is a mini-set within a set. A player is awarded a point for every rally won and the first to 6 points with a margin of 2 wins. Once the players are tied at 6 points, the winner is the first to win by a margin of 2 points. Tiebreaks vary quite widely across different tournaments but there is often an additional rule to this to avoid games from never ending eg. First to 10 points.
                </p>
                <p>Within each game, points are scored in a pretty cryptic way. The score goes up in this fashion: 0, 15, 30, 40. There is a long and detailed history as to the hows and whys of this system which I won't be getting into now. When both sides score a 40 each, the game only ends when someone scores when they have an advantage. When the player has an advantage score, they may lose it if they lose the current point. I've included a small snippet below to indicate how a game would go.
