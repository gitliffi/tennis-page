//Pseudocode for tennis match
//Initialize game
//Check with user if best of 3 or best of 5 match
//Ask for Player A name from user
//Ask for Player B name from user
//Create two buttons for user to click to indicate point won by either Player
//Create scoreboard, two rows with player names
//Create a game score extending out of names
//Score increments with every click
//If tie at 40-all, adv logic applies
//Set scores go up with every game won
//If score ties at 6-all, initiate tie-break
//Match ends when a player reaches score win of 2, if best of 3 chosen, or score win of 3, if best of 5 chosen

//test: create a button that increments a score in a website
